# ðŸ‘¾ Rustboy Color ðŸ‘¾
Rustboy Color is a Gameboy Color emulator written in Rust. Currently, it only reads cartridge binaries and displays the cartridge information.

This is a personal project aimed to learn rust and fulfill the desire to write a gameboy emulator and play my childhood videogames on a piece of software developed entirely by me. 

There is no schedule or rush on the development. I work on the project whenever I have some spare time and the will to continue.  

### Project Goals:

- [X] Full Zilog Z80 instruction set
- [ ] Support for rom, mbc1, mbc2, mbc3 and mbc5 cartridges
- [ ] Develop working RAM
- [ ] Develop graphic RAM
- [ ] Develop IO modules
- [ ] Pass [Blargg's test rom](https://github.com/c-sp/gameboy-test-roms)  
- [ ] Develop graphic user interface
